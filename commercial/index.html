    At Ray's Masonry we've done a wide range of commercial work
    including dairy barns, churches, block walls, warehouses, academic
    buildings and car dealerships. Pictured below are a few examples
    of what we have done over the years. If you have any questions or
    would like to request a quote please feel free to email or call
